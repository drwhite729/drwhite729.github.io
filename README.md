I am a software developer.  I've writing code for many years.  Many programmers write their own code as a hobby, or maybe even with a more serious purpose in mind.  I'm using GitHub right now as a place to store the code for my personal projects.  Hopefully, some of these projects will turn in to something that has more than just personal use.
